# Marching Begins

Marching began at the break of dawn on March 12, 1930 as Gandhi along with 79 others embarked from Sabarmati Ashram to the town of Aslali, Gujarat ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 59 - 63](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)). This also marked the public declaration by Gandhi to all Indians to disobey British laws and take to their nearest shore to produce their own salt. Along the route the marchers stopped at many key towns to deliver speeches and rally more to their cause. For the next 23 days the marchers began their march promptly after morning prayers and spread their mission to combat the British salt laws as they meandered southwards. As the days went on more volunteers attempted to join the march and, slowing at first, Gandhi began allowing them to march alongside them.

The first significant town the marchers stopped at was Nadiad, on March 15th ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 77 - 86](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)). Upon their arrival to the Santram Temple in Nadiad thousands of people came to support the cause and to listen to Gandhi’s speech. 200 new volunteers joined the march from Nadiad as they left the following day towards Boriavi. Even today the place Gandhi stood in Santram Temple is a popular tourist attraction ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-89-years-retracing-the-mahatmas-most-famous-march/articleshow/71402488.cms)). Gandhi’s popularity also began attracting foreign news coverage at around this time and news of his march spread to Europe and North America.

As the marchers entered their 6th day fears of arrests and violent policing increased. With civil disobedience taking place across the country, partially motivated by the march, the British police force was on high alert to suppress any act of sedition. Fears amongst the marchers grew of a brutal suppression of their march, yet the British government had privately decided not to interfere as it may cause greater support for the cause ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 98](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)). As arrests of public supporters of home rule, not including the marchers, increased Gandhi and other marchers began speaking more about the injustice of the arrests. This began on March 19th in the town of Ras on the way to Kareli. In Ras, Gandhi spoke on the unjust arrest of Sardar Patel in the same town only a few weeks back for addressing a crowd ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 103](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)).

On March 21st, in Ankhi, the practice of socially boycotting anyone affiliated with government officials was in effect. Those who held government positions or supported the British government were shunned by the village and were refused food and other supplies ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 114](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)). Upon arriving in Ankhi and hearing the concerns of the boycotted citizens Gandhi pleaded with the village to show compassion and allow those boycotted to receive food and other supplies for their families ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 116](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)).

As the days went on the marchers made more stops in Samni, Derol, Ankleshwar -gaining supporters along the way. Thousands of people would often line the streets along which Gandhi and his volunteers travelled, hoping to catch a glimpse of history being made.

Nearing the end of the journey the marchers became accustomed to thousands of onlookers watching and praising them as they walked from one town to the next. When entering Surat on April 1st rumors had spread that many inspired volunteers had began creating their own salt in bulk and distribution it across the state of Gujarat. April 1st was also a significant day because the crowds began donating large sums of money, especially for commoners, to the cause. Gandhi had strategically chosen a salt march over boycotts of government land because he wanted to fight a law that affected every Indian indiscriminately. Gandhi knew that the poor in India must be just as motivated as the rich for change. In Surat Gandhi encouraged the commoners to make their own Khadi, cloth, and empower themselves to come out of poverty by being self-reliant ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 126](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)).

On April 5th, 1930 Gandhi and the other marchers arrived in Dandi. Prompty after prayers the following morning Gandhi took a dip into the Indian ocean, grabbed a fist of the salty mud, and proclaimed that he was breaking the law ([CWMG Vol. XLIII, 181](https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_volume_thumbview/NDM=#page/96/mode/2up)). Thousands followed in other coastal cities, namely: Bombay, Calcutta, and Tamil Nadu, to take to the ocean and produce their own salt in an act of defiance. 80 marchers with only their words and support defiantly broke the law of the most powerful empire in the world. Gandhi showed that Indians could inflict great financial harm to the British without raising a single hand in violence. The British arrested ~60, 000 for their acts of civil disobedience, but the momentum that followed for home rule never died down. Later that year Mahatma Gandhi was named person of the year by Time Magazine ([What Moves Masses, 1](https://www-jstor-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/4402595?pq-origsite=summon&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)).
