As an unfortunate consequence of displaying the image of Bin Laden across America, many began to associate the visual characteristics of the terrorist with the Sikh community, namely Sikh men. Sikhism promotes the restraint from shaving or shearing any body hair, which is most evident for men, who adorn long untrimmed beards and turbans that contain their hair ([Sikh Hate Crime Victims](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/us/sikh-hate-crime-victims/index.html)). Osama Bin Laden was **not** a devotee of Sikhism, but rather because “the turban, [was] worn since ancient times for purposes including protecting the scalp [and] showing rank and status […]” ([Demystifying Turbans](https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/01/07/demystifying-turbans-much-of-america-doesnt-understand-their-meanings-by-lisa-fernandez/)). Sikh’s are primarily from the Indian subcontinent and found in small numbers in the Middle East. Regardless the visual similarity was noted by many and this led to unforeseen violence.

The violence came to a head when a member of the Sikh community, Balbir Singh Sodhi, was shot five times and killed in an act of hate crime on September 15th, 2001 by Frank Roque ([Balbir Singh Sodhi](https://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/mesa/balbir-singh-sodhi-remembered-18-years-after-hate-fueled-killing-at-mesa-gas-station)). Roque was enraged by the 9/11 attacks and wanted to enact his revenge on the Arab American community ([Sikh Hate Crime Victims](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/us/sikh-hate-crime-victims/index.html)). Roque incorrectly profiled Sodhi as Arab due his turban, beard, and clothing as he was driving through the town of Mesa, Arizona searching for Arab Americans to shoot in rage ([Sikh Hate Crime Victims](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/us/sikh-hate-crime-victims/index.html)). Roque’s own words were “go out and shoot some towel heads” ([Sikh Hate Crime Victims](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/us/sikh-hate-crime-victims/index.html)). Sodhi was an innocent gas station owner who lost his life to the senseless, racially motivated act of violence. The violence continued even after the killing of Sodhi.([Teens Burn Temple](https://www.syracuse.com/vintage/2016/11/throwback_thursday_arson_damag.html))

>"As we remember and mourn the lives of those lost during the tragic 9/11 attacks, we are also reminded of the growing civil rights and safety concerns of Sikh Americans. Since 9/11, we have noticed a marked increase in hate crimes, discrimination and bullying affecting the Sikh community"

The violence was showcased in November of 2001 as a Gurdwara, Sikh place of worship, was mistakenly thought to be named after Bin Laden and was burned down in New York ([Teens Burn Temple](https://www.syracuse.com/vintage/2016/11/throwback_thursday_arson_damag.html)). Then again with the beating of, Surinder Singh Sidhia peaceful shop owner in Los Angeles, for again being mistaken as Bin Laden ([Sikhs Under Attack](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/us/sikh-hate-crimes-list/index.html)). The aggression continued for years as more Sikhs lost their lives to racially motivated acts of violence.

The racial hatred and subsequent violence against Sikhs is heavily correlated with sentiments of Islamophobia and the prevalence of Islamic terrorist attacks. Following the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris there were a number of new hate crimes against Sikhs being committed across the United States. There were three instances of racial slurs and xenophobic comments being shouted towards Sikh men in months following the Paris attacks in New York and California ([Sikhs Under Attack](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/us/sikh-hate-crimes-list/index.html)). There was also a killing in Fresno, California where a 68-year-old Gurcharan Singh Gill was stabbed to death outside his liquor store ([Elderly Sikh Stabbed](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Elderly-Sikh-stabbed-to-death-in-U.S./article13980893.ece)).

Sikhs also face discrimination in other forms in their everyday life. While self-reporting should be taken with a grain of salt some figures that are available surrounding Silk discrimination are given below, by the Sikh Coalition ([Fact Sheet](https://www.sikhcoalition.org/documents/pdf/factsheet-violence-discrimination-against-sikhs-and-minorities.pdf)).


#### Discrimination at School
-	69% of turban wearing Sikhs students report bullying because of their religion
-	30% of which experience inappropriate touching
-	Examples include students who’s had their turban lit of fire, their hair forcibly cut, and assault

#### Discrimination at the Workplace
-	12% report workplace discrimination including being fired or not hired for refusing to cut their hair or remove their turban
-	The New York Police Department still refuses to hire Sikhs who adorn turbans

#### Discrimination in Daily Life
-	Airports regularly selectively search turbaned Sikhs at far higher rates than the average
-	The TSA has regularly refused to audit their secondary search selection process

Awareness of discrimination against Sikhs is often limited in the United States given the extremely small minority that these citizens are with respect to the total population, ~0.1% ([Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/2012/08/06/ask-the-expert-how-many-us-sikhs/#:~:text=The%20World%20Religion%20Database%20at,of%20them%20who%20are%20Sikh.)). Regardless the Sikh community has faced years of racism and racially motivated violence that more should be aware of. The unfortunate visual similarities between Sikh men and the violent terrorists shown on the news networks has cost many their lives and their respect in society. Ignorance, islamophobia, xenophobia, racism, and anger have resulted in a small minority of peaceful citizens of the United States to feel unsafe for the last two decades.

_Note: Violence and racism against Sikhs is the primary aspect of focus for this article, but its shouldn’t be ignored that the majority of Islamophobic violence is directed as Muslims and only occurs in comparatively smaller numbers against the Sikh community, largely due to mistaken identity._
