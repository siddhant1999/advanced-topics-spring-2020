Use a COVID-19 API to represent the COVID-19 data in a way that you beleive captures the impact on the world than https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6

A good starting point for an API is https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest

Use it to show any interesting trends

Consider things like:
active cases
cases per capita
cases in red/blue states
cases / population density
showing the growth on the country as opposed to cases
what countries are the most dangerous to travel to


Feel free to use other APIs to build further functionality
