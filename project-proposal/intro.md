## Introduction

The COVID-19 Pandemic is perhaps the defining characteristic of the year 2020. There are a number of digital technologies being used to combat the pandemic, map it, detect it, and diagnose for it. Given the vast array of applications that digital technologies can be used for we believe communicating the current state of the spread is of paramount importance. Spread is more than just the total number of cases in the world and that isn't being properly reflected in existing sources.

There is a tremendous amount of data surrounding the pandemic and its spread throughout the world. In our proposal we will outline the goal, scope, and budgetary requirements of creating more digestible and human friendly COVID-19 spread graphic. There are a number of different components we believe are important for making decisions and being informed about the COVID-19 pandemic that are noticeably lacking today.

Our project will be an automatically updating webpage consisting of 2 maps.

#### Daily Increase / Population Density (Map 1)

The rate of spread of the Coronavirus, as an infectious disease, is strongly correlated with the population density of the region it spreads in. To be able to evaluate whether a region is effectively combatting the spread we need to correct for this bias.

By being able to see the relationship between the daily increase in cases proportionate to the population density in that area it’ll be easier for users to see hotspots to avoid and how population density can often make it seem as though an area is particularly badly hit. By focusing on daily increase as opposed to total cases we intentionally focus our efforts on how fast the disease is spreading and not much it may have spread in the past.

#### Daily Increase and Lawmaker Decisions (Map 2)

The policy decisions that lawmakers make surrounding public health have major consequences for their constituents. To help make residents more aware of the policy decisions and the impact that those decisions have on the spread of COVID-19 we will be showing both the data on the number of daily new cases along with the Tweets by the governors of that state, governments of the state (the governors' official office), and the state health department that relate to the pandemic. The Tweets will serve as a stand in for their concrete policy decisions as it’s more accessible and more consistent across different states. The actual specific policy decisions can be difficult to track and often have wildly different methods of being presented online, if at all. For this map we’ll be providing the party the governor belongs to, the live Tweets from the various sources, and the scale of the daily increase in that state.

*We’ll also be building out a historical “playback” option where users can see the data for both maps over a selected period of time.*
